The plugin will create an in-memory layer for each search result. The attribute table of the layer will contain all the standard metadata returned by a GBIF occurrence search. To save the layer permanently, right click on it and use the built-in QGIS "save as" functionality.

You can install the plugin from the QGIS plugin repository as shown in the above video.

I would welcome any contributions, please do so via a [pull request](https://github.com/kartoza/SpeciesExplorer/pulls). If you encounter any bugs with the plugin, please file an [issue](https://github.com/kartoza/SpeciesExplorer/issues).
